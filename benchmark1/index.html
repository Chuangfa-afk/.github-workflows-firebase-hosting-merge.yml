The game will utilize a variety of techniques, such as immersive environments, interactive elements, and dynamic changes based on the player's actions.</p>
            
        <b>TECHNOLOGY: </b>

        <p>First Person Puzzle will be developed for Windows, macOS platforms using a suitable game engine such as Wolfie2D to build first-person point-and-click puzzle games. The rendering technology will be selected based on the engine's capabilities, and all music and sound effects management will be handled using appropriate tools. Artwork will be designed to create an immersive experience and complement the game's unique mechanics and atmosphere.</p>

        <b>BACK STORY: </b>
        
        <p>The player assumes the role of a janitor who has worked at the same mundane job for years; cleaning an eerie facility in the dead of night. The night shift pays well, but not well enough to pay for a therapist, and over the yars the janitor's mental fortitude has eroded. As a result, the janitor bears whitness to a number of strange events throughout their shift. A static enemy lurks in the shadows, forcing the player to constantly interact with it to avoid danger. The facility seems to have no end, resembling an endless chain of rooms, and each of which has different puzzle or mechanic that the player must solve to progress.</p>
            
        <b>OBJECTIVE: </b>
            
        <p>The player's objective is to navigate through the seemingly infinite facility, solve puzzles, and uncover the truth behind the events taking place. By interacting with the environment and overcoming challenges, the player will slowly unravel the story and reveal the identity of the enemy that is hunting them.</p>
            
        <b>GAMEPLAY: </b>

Each room will feature a different mechanic or challenge that must be completed to progress to the next area. The player will need to constantly interact with the static enemy to avoid danger, adding an element of tension and urgency to the gameplay.</p>
            
        <p>The puzzles will vary in difficulty and complexity, requiring the player to think critically and creatively to find solutions. Some puzzles may involve manipulating objects in the environment, while others may require the player to gather information or use their knowledge of the facility to solve problems. As the game progresses, the story will unfold through environmental clues, notes, and other narrative elements.</p>
