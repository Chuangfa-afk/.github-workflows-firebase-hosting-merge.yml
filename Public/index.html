As a result, the janitor bears whitness to a number of strange events throughout their shift. A static enemy lurks in the shadows, forcing the player to constantly interact with it to avoid danger. The facility seems to have no end, resembling an endless chain of rooms, and each of which has different puzzle or mechanic that the player must solve to progress.</p>
            
        <b>OBJECTIVE: </b>

        <p>The game will be presented in a 2D first-person perspective, with the player able to explore rooms and interact with various objects to solve puzzles.

They player will have to cycle through the different images and interact with both in game objects (like keys or a bucket) to solve puzzles, as well as in game enemies that may require constant input to keep them at bay. On top of this, each room will feature a different mechanic or challenge that must be completed to progress to the next area.</p>
            
        <p>The puzzles will vary in difficulty and complexity, requiring the player to think critically and creatively to find solutions.
